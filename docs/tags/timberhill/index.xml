      <description>The Timberhill Tennis club video project came to me on recommendation from a member of the club, who happened to be my former video production instructor from OSU. She had heard about my work and wanted to team up to tackle this project.
In the end this became a fun project that allowed me to use some brand new equipment, and learn about new abilities inside of Adobe After Effects.</description>
