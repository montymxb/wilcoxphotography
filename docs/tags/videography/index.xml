      <description>The Timberhill Tennis club video project came to me on recommendation from a member of the club, who happened to be my former video production instructor from OSU. She had heard about my work and wanted to team up to tackle this project.
In the end this became a fun project that allowed me to use some brand new equipment, and learn about new abilities inside of Adobe After Effects.</description>

      <description>For new readers, this project may seem like an outrageously over-the-top &amp;lsquo;community theater&amp;rsquo; piece &amp;ndash; but I assure you, this is exactly what the Murphy&amp;rsquo;s furniture brand is all about. It is always a creative challenge in balancing between &amp;ldquo;extreme cheese&amp;rdquo; and a video type people will genuinely enjoy watching.
Kathy and Mary are sisters and co-owners of Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Furniture &amp;ndash; a family owned and operated store in deep Hillsboro Oregon, along the TV highway.</description>
