I do weddings, special occasions, and more. I have also done work for Oregon State University as well.

## Weddings

Weddings are one of my absolute favorite events to capture because, while there may be a set schedule of events, each wedding has their own unique spin that makes it truly a special 'once in a lifetime" story.


From the major beats, to the tiny details, my goal as a videographer and photographer is to make your wedding video as fun to watch now, as it will be when you share it with the next generation.

## Oregon State University

I graduated from OSU with a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a specialty in video production.

During my time at as an undergrad I worked on a large project with OSU Anthropology & The Bureau of Land Management.
More information about that project can be found here

In my current role at OSU, I am the lead video producer of the Student Multimedia Studio. Below are projects that I managed, produced, directed and edited.
