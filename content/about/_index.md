My name is Hayden and I'm a media producer, videographer and amatuer photographer.


I currently work at Oregon State University, where I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts, with a focus in video production. During my time as an undergrad I spent most of my time in the student media tv broadcast studio, working on a variety of different productions.

â€‹

After graduating I worked with several video production partners including Two Penguins Productions, Brad's World Reptiles, and The Boys and Girls Club of Portland.



In my role at OSU my job is to act as multimedia consultant, trainer, and perform duties as the lead video producer for the Student Multimedia Studio. In that time I've worked on a range of products that are both outward facing, as well internal videos that act as tutorials for students of all skillsets.

In total I have been working in video production for eight years and during that time I have worked on a variety of projects, including commercial, non-profit, and educational materials.

On this site you'll find examples of my most recent projects which demonstrated my range of skills.

If you're interested in creating a project together, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm always interested to hear about ways to take ideas and concepts into the world of digital multimedia.
