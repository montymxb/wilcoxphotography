For new readers, this project may seem like an outrageously over-the-top 'community theater' piece -- but I assure you, this is exactly what the Murphy's furniture brand is all about. It is always a creative challenge in balancing between "extreme cheese" and a video type people will genuinely enjoy watching.

Kathy and Mary are sisters and co-owners of Murphy's Furniture -- a family owned and operated store in deep Hillsboro Oregon, along the TV highway. The Murphy's brand is based off of two things. First, that they've been a strong and proud member of the local community for many many years. Their client base is right in their own backyard, and the rural community of families that frequent the store has been doing so for two generations. Secondly, the Murphy's style has always been "family focused" and "homegrown", and that has often times lends itself to homegrown solutions for storytelling. Since starting their foray into the realm of TV broadcast this made-in-house style has worked well for them because it is fun, quirky, and most importantly memorable. They receive positive reports from the families and communities who love to see what kind of eccentric ideas Kathy and Mary have come up with.

I've been working with the Murphy's brand since their previous producer decided to retire in 2015. Since then I believe the production quality has grown substantially while still maintaining that "homegrown" spirit.

## Murphy's 46th Anniversary

When Kathy and Mary first came to me about the 46th anniversary commercial spot, my initial thought was to follow through with a theme that we had started using the year previous. If the 45th anniversary was the "Sapphire" anniversary, then the 46th anniversary was going to be the "Poetry Anniversary".

Somewhere in between trying to rhyme 'furniture' with 'minimal expenditure' it dawned on me that creating a new anniversary sale spot every year wouldn't be sustainable for Murphy's furniture in the long run, and that what this brand really needs is a spot that they can keep in their back pocket and play each year without having to go through the process of starting the production process again from scratch.

In a market that is increasingly moving away from brick and mortar storefronts, Kathy and Mary have an uphill battle of trying to stay relevant with their customers and compete with their cheaper competitors like IKEA, or Amazon. Keeping  them from having to recreate a new spot every year would keep money in their pocket.

In that same vein, creating a new anniversary spot every year was not going to give them the same return on investment as having an "evergreen" commercial that they could really get some use out of.

So we pivoted to where Murphy's has come from over the past 46 years.

During this process Kathy showed me photos of when her parents opened and ran the store in the 70s -- when it was originally called "Murphy's Manor Antiques". The opening day was Sept 11th, 1973.

I knew that each year's anniversary theme was going to change, but if we celebrated when Murphy's furniture was first founded -- that would be a constant, and would lend itself to a timeless spot Mary and Kathy could run every year.

When I originally pitched a 70s style theme for the spot, Kathy was immediately in love with the idea. Practically the first thing out of her mouth was "I have afros in my closet from last halloween!". Perfect.

I spent the next few days looking up 70s style artwork, graphic elements, fonts, clothing styles and putting together a theme deck to present to the ladies. Once I had my visual elements, I wrote up a rough draft of the script and sent it off to Kathy and Mary for approval.

The typical turnaround time for each of these commercial spots is about a month. Kathy reaches out to me and says something like, "we're having a so-and-so sale" next month, can you come up an write a script for it? Oh and by the way, we want to include this idea..." This idea is typically the baseline for the 'quirky-ness' of the spot.

When I pitched the 70s theme, Kathy wanted me to include Mary.... as a baby...since she was born in the 70s. Also, baby Mary needs to have an afro.

Hmm.

## The Challenges

Having not been alive in the 70s my concept of that time period has been heavily influenced by stereotypes. Somehow I needed to strike a balance between presenting the spot as a tongue-in-cheek parody of the decade, while also making it fit in that visual theme.

Among the conceptual challenges, the client was dead set on making sure "baby Mary" was shown in the scene. However it was decided that we couldn't use a real baby because then we'd have to include some sort of visual clue that the baby was actually Mary -- the current co-owner of the store -- from 50 years ago.

A visual clue was going to take too much screen time to explain the concept, and even 3 seconds of a 30 second spot is 10%, so I decided that we should take this opportunity to "lean into" the cheesiness of the spot.

A quick green screen key and a little bit of masking later, and a "baby Mary" with an afro was ready to be imposed onto our prop bundle.

Lastly, part of my original concept was to do a flashback to the "original" murphy's commercial from 1973 to show how far Murphy's has grown since then.

Obviously no such spot existed at the time, so I did my very best to recreate what I thought an old 70s tv set would look and sound like. I knew that it needed interlaced lines, a refresh rate error from a shoddy cathode-ray tube, and a muted color profile that recognized that, while colors were vibrant at the time, color tvs were a relatively new concept and that the picture quality would be poor.

## Final Delivery

At the end of the day, I'm still pretty proud of this spot. I supplemented a majority of the script with animated or static photo elements to keep the audience focused on the product being sold, over the way in which it was being sold.
