The Timberhill Tennis club video project came to me on recommendation from a member of the club, who happened to be my former video production instructor from OSU. She had heard about my work and wanted to team up to tackle this project.

In the end this became a fun project that allowed me to use some brand new equipment, and learn about new abilities inside of Adobe After Effects.

## The Project

We started with a base from an element that already existed, it was just a matter of making it better, from the ground up.

The owner and operator of Timberhill Tennis club had been using an old spot for several years - [and it was dated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21ky5a8C82s).

This spot had been running on ESPN for localized broadcast during Wimbledon season for the past 5 years.

Besides some glaring issues with crushed shadows, and a very noticeable interlaced video, this commercial doesn't have any music! I couldn't understand what I was watching when I first saw it.

Personally, I'm not sure if it was created by a local college student, or someone who had just barely enough camera and editing skills to put together a rough draft that accidentally got published -- but, oof.

All things considered, the client liked the content and wanted to do a new spot that was essentially the same. It needed to cover the following:

>"The :30 spot will air on Comcast’s ESPN during French & Wimbledon open. Hunter (the client) is happy with the previous script and shots, just wants to update them. Audience is kids, women, retirees, adults and diversity of players. Wants to emphasize advantages of memberships, league games, programs for connecting. Biggest selling point is SOCIALIZING! We discussed different times for shooting different player types, ie kids, moms, coed adults etc. Hunter is not thrilled with Logo on the previous spot. Would like a new font and a new background for the graphics. Deadline is June 1, 2019"

With a need to capture fast paced, athletic actions; I was very anxious to break out my new Panasonic GH5 for it's inaugural commercial project.

## Project Challenges

While it seemed like very simple concept to begin with, logistically this video became very complex in a short amount of time.

This was one of the first commercial projects I had worked on with another team member involved. Additionally, my partner on this project was a former video production instructor of mine. It was important to me that she saw where I was in the process, as we prepared meetings with the client.

My partner, Amy, and I poured over the previous script, making numerous attempts to make it flashy, fun, and upbeat- but to no avail. To my surprize, the client insisted on keeping the original script, and keeping "Socialize" as the most important element of the spot.

At the time of this production, Amy and I were working full time at Oregon State University. With full time day jobs, scheduling a time to shoot proved to be increasingly difficult since most of the tennis classes happened during the work day. Additionally, we learned that the TTC (Timberhill Tennis Club) is essentially dead on weekends.

I knew that we needed big groups, with varying ages and skill-sets if we were going to capture the full scope of what the TTC had to offer. If we were going to get the shots we need, we had to know exactly what age group was practicing, and what time they would be present. Calling in actors was not practical for the client's budget.

This spot was scheduled to run by the end of spring, however it had been a particularly wet spring in Corvallis that year, especially during the time we were preparing to film. On top of our previous issue of finding the right people at the right time, we had time find a time when it wasn't raining to film the outdoor shots.

2 weeks before the due date we hit a break in the weather and ran over to film shots of the exterior courts. But there was a problem with the shot. I was unaware that puddles on the court are seen as a safety concern. The original shot looked like this:

This presented an interesting challenge. The client had told me the the footage was "unusable" and that it should be shot again when the weather was nice, but there wasn't any indication that was going to happen any time soon.

Fortunate for me, this was right around the time that Adobe had introduced a new feature called "Content Aware Fill" for video. After an hour of playing with the file, the client thought that we had restaged the shot with the same people without him knowing!

With a little color grading, this outdoor shot on a cloudy spring day suddenly becomes a clear, warm sunny day in summer.

## Results and Final Delivery

> “I like it a lot, great job!” - TTC Client

With some creative framing, brand appropriate coloring, not to mention an actual music track (Finally!) this was one of my favorite videos at the time.

This spot continues to run on local Comcast channels in the Salem/Corvallis area on ESPN during tennis season.
